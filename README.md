In this project, we compare the crime rates of Vancouver and Chicago from 2003 through 2017. We compare the types of crime, GPS location of each crime, time and date, as well as the overall amount of crime in each city. We used three tools to visualize the data: Tableau, Bokeh, and D3. The Tableau visualization focused on the amount of murder, theft, and assault on each holiday of each year. The Bokeh visualization provided four basic charts for all crimes in the data sets. The D3 visualization mapped each crime to their corresponding geographical location. We found that Tableau provides exciting and creative diagrams that are functionally limited while Bokeh provides basic and traditional charts and diagrams that are informative and versatile. Thus, Tableau focuses on aesthetics but not functionality, while Bokeh focuses on functionality but not aesthetics. However, D3 combines the positive properties of both Tableau and Bokeh providing creative, informative, versatile, and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
